Loki is the Goddess of mischief, deception, chaos, and shadows. Known as the **Deceiver of the Gods**, the **Lady of Lies**, the **Mistress of Mystery**, and the **Trickster**, Loki is not often worshipped by Clerics and Paladins. Instead she acts as a patron to many Warlocks and has a following of Rogues and Bards who admire her cunning and trickery. She is as fickle as the wind, constantly floating from one place to another, leaving chaos in her wake.
# Description
![[Loki.png|500]]

Loki is a powerful shapeshifter, she can disguise herself as a travelling merchant, a poor street urchin, or even a skittering squirrel, looking for nuts. Her presence is therefore often hidden to such a degree that even her siblings are unable to detect her unless she wants to be seen. But, when she does choose to make herself known, she presents as a somewhat short woman with dark braided hair, olive skin, and freckles. Her pupilless eyes are a deep purple with a subtle pearlescent shimmer. She dresses in shades of black and gold, and carries her symbol, ..., on her hip.


## Personality
Loki is the embodiment of [[Alignment#Chaotic|Chaotic]] [[Alignment#Evil|Evil]], she despises order and authority, rejoices in the toppling of hierarchies, and cares little for the consequences of her actions.
