### Lawful
A lawful creature has a strict set of rules that they follow, be that the law of the country, their internal set of morals, or the decree of a God or lesser authority. Lawful creatures find comfort in order, structure, and justice, even if these things might not always be in everyone's favour.

### Chaotic
A chaotic creature treasures freedom, self-expression, and individuality. They question authority and are often inconsistent in the application of their own morality.

### Good
A good creature cares a great deal about other people. They tend to be selfless and generous, and often sacrifice their own wellbeing to ensure the wellbeing of others.

### Evil
An evil creature is selfish and looks out for their own interest. They will often do what is best for them, even if it comes at the cost of others.

### Neutral
A neutral creature sees value in both sides, often aiming to find a compromise. They will act selfishly just as often as they are generous. Or they will follow the laws as long as the laws make sense to them.
