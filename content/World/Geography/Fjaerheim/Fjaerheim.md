# Government
Fjaerheim can be described as a feudal monarchy that thrives on seafaring trade and conquest. After ages of division the country was first [[#Unification of Fjaerheim|united]] by [[#Skarling Hoodless]], who ruled for the better part of two decades before being succeeded by [[#Gwynn Wildhair]]. Fjaerheim is currently ruled by [[#Bjorn Bloodless]] after he won [[#The Battle of The High Places]].

Bjorn is a violent and dangerous man who forced many jarls to bend the knee in the aftermath of [[Fjaerheim#The Battle of The High Places|The Battle of The High Places]]. His brash ruthlessness is tempered by the counsel of his uncle, Black Skaldr.

# Society
## Social Structure
The society in Fjaerheim is strictly hierarchical and the people are separated into three main social classes which determine an individual's lifestyle, influence, and duties within their community. These classes encapsulate everyone from the rulers to the commoners. In order of importance, these classes are:
- **Jarls**
	Local and regional rulers. **Jarls** are at the pinnacle of Fjaerheim society, wielding significant power and influence, and commanding several [[Fjaerheim#Crews|crews]]. They are the local authority and answer to none other than the current monarch.
- **Karls**
	Skilled warriors and members of a [[Fjaerheim#Crews|crew]]. **Karls** are some of the strongest warriors, and most (in)famous people in Fjaerheim. They participate in raids, enforce the law, and lead **Thralls** into battle.
- **Thralls**
	Peasants. **Thralls** constitute the majority of the Fjaerheim population, they are farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders etc. **Thralls** are the subjects of their local **jarl**, and can be called upon to fight in wars or territorial disputes when the need arises.

Despite the strict hierarchy, social mobility is very prominent in Fjaerheim. Through feats of strength and skill - or just as often through treachery and cunning - people can climb their way up the ladder towards **jarldom**, and even to the throne as seen with Bjorn Bloodless in [[#The Battle of The High Places]] 

#### Crews
In Fjaerheim society, a **crew** is one of the smallest militant organizations, consisting of around a half-dozen **karls**. Each **crew** is led by a **chief**, a [[Fjaerheim#Named Men|Named]] man or woman who is typically chosen based on a combination of wisdom and might, and is commanded by the local **Jarl**, often in some military or law enforcement capacity.

#### Named Men
Among **karls** there is a distinct subgroup of notorious warriors called **Named Men**. As the title implies, these are **karls** that have received a **name** such as *Bloodless*, *Frost Hammer*, or *Threetrees*. A **karl** can be **named** by their **chief** or their **jarl**, which is seen as a great honor.

# History
The short but deadly history of Fjaerheim is mired in bloody infighting, ambitious backstabbing, and opportunistic alliances.

### Unification of Fjaerheim

### The Battle of The High Places
Under the rule of [[#Gwynn Wildhair]], the capital was in the west, in [[#Norheim]]. She strived for peaceful trade with [[The Dominion]] but that didn't sit well in the east of Fjaerheim, which didn't have many places to do trade with. [[#Bjorn Bloodless]] took advantage of this unrest and started a rebellion in the east. First he overthrew the leadership of [[#Holmstad]] by defeating [[#White-eye Hansul]] in the circle, and recruiting him to his cause. Without much resistance he swept through [[#Uffrith]] and [[#Lillefest]], and gained the support of [[#Durinnri Golden]] in his defiance of [[#Gwynn Wildhair|Queen Wildhair]]. 
In the meantime the Queen gathered her forces in the west. [[#Jolly Yon Cumber]], [[#Thekkris Steepfield]], and [[#Caul Shivers]] all rallied behind her to meet the rebellion head on. The two forces met in [[#High Place Pass]] where their battle raged on for three days and three nights, until, at the dawn of the fourth day, [[#Stranger-Come-Knocking]] arrived from [[#The Frigid Isles]].
He attacked the left flank and managed to cut through the front lines, outflanking and decimating the Queen's exhausted forces. 
Both [[#Caul Shivers]] and [[#Gwynn Wildhair]] were slain, while [[#Jolly Yon Cumber]], [[#Thekkris Steepfield]], and [[#Red Gwyndala]] were captured. The two jarls bent the knee and agreed to serve under [[#Bjorn Bloodless]] to avoid further bloodshed. [[#Red Gwyndala]], however, refused the offer and, with the help of [[#Rudd Threetrees]], managed to escape her captivity.
