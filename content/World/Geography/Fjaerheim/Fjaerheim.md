# Social Structure
The society in Fjaerheim is strictly hierarchical and the people are separated into three main social classes which determine an individual's lifestyle, influence, and duties within their community. These classes encapsulate everyone from the rulers to the commoners. In order of importance, these classes are:
- **Jarls** -
	Local and regional rulers. **Jarls** are at the pinnacle of Fjaerheim society, wielding significant power and influence, and commanding several [[Fjaerheim#Crews|crews]]. They are the local authority and answer to none other than the [[Fjaerheim#King|current monarch]].
- **Karls** -
	Skilled warriors and members of a [[Fjaerheim#Crews|crew]]. **Karls** are some of the strongest warriors, and most (in)famous people in Fjaerheim. They participate in raids, enforce the law, and lead **Thralls** into battle.
- **Thralls** -
	Peasants. **Thralls** constitute the majority of the Fjaerheim population, they are farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders etc. **Thralls** are the subjects of their local **jarl**, and can be called upon to fight in wars or territorial disputes when the need arises.

#### Crews
In Fjaerheim society, a **crew** is one of the smallest militant organizations, consisting of around a half-dozen **karls**. Each **crew** is led by a **chief**, a [[Fjaerheim#Named Men|Named]] man or woman who is typically chosen based on a combination of wisdom and might, and is commanded by the local **Jarl**, often in some military or law enforcement capacity.

#### Named Men
Among **karls** there is a distinct subgroup of notorious warriors called **Named Men**. As the title implies, these are **karls** that have received a **name** such as *Bloodless*, *Frost Hammer*, or *Threetrees*. A **karl** can be **named** by their **chief** or their **jarl**, which is seen as a great honor.
